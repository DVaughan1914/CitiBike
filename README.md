# SUMMARY
A ride-sharing program like Citi Bike is a great offering for a community. With 2,344,224 bike rides in August there is much data to analyze. Most Citi Bike trips are short, less than one hour. The Citi Bike data shows that bike sharing is used for commuters and those looking for some weekend fun. Subscribers are the main business model. When looking at subscriber rate and duration of use, men tend to use the program more. Having a bike repair plan is a must especially for the bikes used in the most popular areas.

A few additional visualizations to perform with the given data set are an analysis of times of bike usage and age range. It would also help to look at how far do bikers travel and which stations are most popular. A closer examination of the station locations might provide clarity on why more women aren't using the bike-share program.
